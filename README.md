This is a golang script that takes a csv file that has call data and sequences it based on two ID fields. There is the master ID and the slave ID. Every record in the table has both ID fields and they are non-null. Every record's master ID is equal to the slave ID of the record prior in the same sequence. For example, if I call the IVR and press a few buttons in the script e.g. "press 1 for english, press 2 for spanish, etc.." then my initial call in will create a record where both ID fields (master and slave) are equal. The next option I press creates another record in the database where the Master ID field is equal to the previous slave ID. This continues until I'm finished or I hang up. Using a recursive forward trace I can sequence unordered data from this database so I can see what every caller did and which options they chose.
